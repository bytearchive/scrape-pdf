working on pdf round trip and reading in clojure.

currently, it looks like the data.codec library can do a round-trip from a pdf to b64 and back with its own encoding, but 
cannot take a pdf encoded by python and convert it; there's a slight difference in the b64 encoding schemes.

since python seems to be able to handle javascript encoding, for purposes of reading and processing data out of chrome extension 
it'll have to be python to process the documents.  that's ok.
